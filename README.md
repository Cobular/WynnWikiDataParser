This is a little tool that parses the data from the wynncraft wiki https://wynncraft.gamepedia.com/Wynncraft_Wiki (and can probably be modified to work with any Gamepedia wiki, but that's an exercise for the reader). You just need to dump the data from the Special:Export page (https://wynncraft.gamepedia.com/Special:Export) and then place that xml file (should be named data.xml) into the dist folder. Once that's done, you should just be able to run everything and get some handy dandy json data containing the coordinates of all the locations found!
This is very specialized so I don't expect this to be useful to literally anyone else, but if you need to pull the coordinate data of locations from the wynncraft wiki, you're in luck!!
